# Intro

This repo is a friday-fun project where I tipped my toes in the world of Lua and the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

My day started from looking at how drop tables work in the Old School Runescape Wiki.
To my surprise it used Lua modules with Scribunto extension to create the expected drops from monsters.
I wanted to contribute and test out writing a new wiki page, so I made some improvements for [this page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Killing_ankous).
After that I created an entirely [new page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Scurrius#Solo) about another monster referencing other similar pages.

## Fun

I was inspired by the game [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) and I wanted to delve deeper into Lua.
After setting up the tools I continued with the help of a related introductory video, code examples and documentation.

This repository was created to share and document the progress, including HTML version of the game built using [LÖVE Web Builder](https://schellingb.github.io/LoveWebBuilder/).

Todo:
- Deploy the game
